This repository contains projects in python:

Assesed Excersise 1 (With GUI)-Cavan Day-Lewis.py - Calculates values for arctan using a taylor series expansion.

Assesed Excersise 2 - Integration calculated using Simpson's rule for Fresnel diffraction. This program shows what the diffraction pattern of light is as it passes through a thin square apperture.

Assessed Exercise 3-With GUI - A simulation of the sky diving jump performed by Felix Baumgartner, using both analytical and numerical methods.

Assessed Exercise 4 - with GUI - A simulation of a rocket performing a bypass of the moon using only gravity.
